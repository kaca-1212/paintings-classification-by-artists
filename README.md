# paintings-classification-by-artists
ML Projekat, Matematiƒçki fakultet, septembar 2020.

The main idea behind this project is comparing different techniques in order to classify 7462 paintings by 15 artists (subset taken from Kaggle and classes are approximately equally balanced), particulary SVM with feature extraction and CNN (pretrained ResNet50v2 and DenseNet121).

Notes: Project root should be working directory for running scripts. In order to run SVM scripts, you will need gist package which installation is not available with pip. Steps to install correct gist package are located in `install_gist_rq.sh`
